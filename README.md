	Results
	* Dynamsoft’s JavaScript barcode scanner SDK ($$)
	* QuaggaJS (free)
	* ZXing (?)
	* Shape Detection API (New partial support maybe not iOS)
		* chrome://flags -> Experimental Web Platform features -> enable

	* [Scanning barcodes with built-in mobile camera and HTML5](https://a.kabachnik.info/reading-barcodes-with-built-in-camera-with-html5.html#fileapi)
		* Pure JavaScript alternatives utilizing the library QuaggaJS
			* only library supporting live-detection of barcodes in the camera's live stream
		* HTML5 File API
			* The most simple way to scan a barcode with JavaScript works by capturing a picture with the HTML5 File API
			* mobile device will open a popup letting you choose, where to get the file from - including the camera. Selecting the latter will open the regular camera app. After the picture was taken, it will be given back to the JavaScript for further processing.
		* HTML5 getUserMedia API
			* Using the getUserMedia API a web application can gain access to the live stream of the built-in cameras. 
			* Using the getUserMedia API a web application can gain access to the live stream of the built-in cameras
			* Unfortunately, it is far not that well supported by browsers
			* possible to embed the live video stream of the camera into the web page at any place and even to control it: switch front and back camera, adjust the brightness, etc.
			* The main one is the lack of autofocus for video via getUserMedia
			* Without autofocus the barcode will always appear blurred because it is much closer

		* Detailed description of how to use QuaggaJS
		* QuaggaJS is an extension of zxing
	* [The Shape Detection API: a picture is worth a thousand words, faces, and barcodes](https://web.dev/shape-detection/)
		* Barcode detection has launched in Chrome 83 on certified devices with Google Play Services installed.
		* Shape Detection API currently supports the detection of faces, barcodes, and text.
		* Shopping apps can allow their users to scan EAN or UPC barcodes of items in a physical store to compare prices online.
		* Web applications can use text detection to translate texts such as, for example, restaurant menus.
	* [Zxing Vs Google Vision](https://medium.com/@lkumar.sakare/zxing-vs-google-vision-fc3be8d83ace) 
		* Zxing library and google vision library in your project to scan the QR code and Barcode
		* ZXing 
			* “zebra crossing” is a barcode image processing library implemented in Java
			* The supported barcode formats include UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 93, Code 128, QR Code, Data Matrix, Aztec, PDF 417, etc.
			* Not good for multiple 1D barcodes
			* Zxing is not that much accurate than Google vision
		* Google vision library (maybe not web app)
			* 1D barcodes: EAN-13, EAN-8, Code-39, Code-93, Code-128, UPC-A, UPC-E, ITF, Codabar
			* 2D barcodes: PDF-417, AZTEC, QR Code, Data Matrix
			* detect multiple barcodes at once and work in any orientation
			* Google vision library is more faster, accurate and flexible than any other scanner library.
			* Google vision depends on native library downloaded post-install to perform scanning.
