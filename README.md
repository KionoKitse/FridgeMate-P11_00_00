### Notebook

	* Dynamsoft’s JavaScript barcode scanner SDK ($$)
	* QuaggaJS (free)
	* ZXing (?)

		* chrome://flags -> Experimental Web Platform features -> enable
	* 
	
	* Research
		* [Scanning barcodes with built-in mobile camera and HTML5](https://a.kabachnik.info/reading-barcodes-with-built-in-camera-with-html5.html#fileapi)
			* pure JavaScript alternatives utilizing the library QuaggaJS
				* only library supporting live-detection of barcodes in the camera's live stream
			* HTML5 File API
				* The most simple way to scan a barcode with JavaScript works by capturing a picture with the HTML5 File API 
				* mobile device will open a popup letting you choose, where to get the file from - including the camera. Selecting the latter will open the regular camera app. After the picture was taken, it will be given back to the JavaScript for further processing. 
			* HTML5 getUserMedia API
				* Using the getUserMedia API a web application can gain access to the live stream of the built-in cameras. 
				* Using the getUserMedia API a web application can gain access to the live stream of the built-in cameras
				* Unfortunately, it is far not that well supported by browsers
				* possible to embed the live video stream of the camera into the web page at any place and even to control it: switch front and back camera, adjust the brightness, etc.
				* The main one is the lack of autofocus for video via getUserMedia
				* Without autofocus the barcode will always appear blurred because it is much closer

		* [The Shape Detection API: a picture is worth a thousand words, faces, and barcodes](https://web.dev/shape-detection/)
			* Barcode detection has launched in Chrome 83 on certified devices with Google Play Services installed.
			* Shape Detection API currently supports the detection of faces, barcodes, and text.
			* Shopping apps can allow their users to scan EAN or UPC barcodes of items in a physical store to compare prices online.
			* Web applications can use text detection to translate texts such as, for example, restaurant menus.
		* [Zxing Vs Google Vision](https://medium.com/@lkumar.sakare/zxing-vs-google-vision-fc3be8d83ace) 
			* Zxing library and google vision library in your project to scan the QR code and Barcode
			* ZXing 
				* “zebra crossing” is a barcode image processing library implemented in Java
				* The supported barcode formats include UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 93, Code 128, QR Code, Data Matrix, Aztec, PDF 417, etc.
				* Not good for multiple 1D barcodes
				* Zxing is not that much accurate than Google vision
				* 
			* Google vision library (maybe not web app)
				* 1D barcodes: EAN-13, EAN-8, Code-39, Code-93, Code-128, UPC-A, UPC-E, ITF, Codabar
				* 2D barcodes: PDF-417, AZTEC, QR Code, Data Matrix
				* detect multiple barcodes at once and work in any orientation
				* Google vision library is more faster, accurate and flexible than any other scanner library.
				* Google vision depends on native library downloaded post-install to perform scanning.

Barcode scanning
One of the features of this software will be some way to keep track of what ingredients are available in the pantry. For this I was thinking that it would be useful to have some sort of way to quickly update the pantry without manually inputing in each value. For this, I'm thinking it would be nice to be able to scan barcodes. The barcodes would be useful when I don't have a receipt and would be an easy way to quickly update the pantry since a lot of products have the same UPC code regardless of the retailer. 
There are a lot of functions in this app that will be difficult but this is the one that I have the least amount of understanding around and would be highly specific. I'm focusing on this aspect first since it will make my life much easier if I start from a platform that I know already supports barcode reading. In deciding what method to implement I started by looking for tutorials for how to do barcode reading in a web app. What I've found is that there are some pretty good tutorials and examples out there so it's not going to be groundbreaking new stuff. I have a full list of notes and links in the <a href="https://github.com/KionoKitse/FridgeMate-P11_00_00/blob/main/README.md">"GitHub README"</a> file under the Notebook section. The summary from my research is that there are two-ish options that I'm considering. The first option is using QuaggaJS or ZXing for a fairly capable standard barcode reading option. It will work on pretty much any modern browser and seems to be well loved by the community. The other option is making use of the Shape Detection API. This is fairly new so it is only supported in Chrome and requires enabling the Experimental Web Platform features. It seems to be fast and works well but it doesn't have widespread adoption yet and I'm not sure if it will work with iOS. For now I'm thinking that it would be best to start with QuaggaJS first and if that doesn't work move to the Shape Detection API.
