MySQL with JavaScript: APPROVED
One of the critical components of this app is going to be the database. I've already decided on the database structure and that I'll be using MySQL to manage that database. This week I just finished doing a MySQL and JavaScript tutorial found <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/using-node-mysql-javascript-client/">here</a>. I found the tutorial to be really easy to follow and cover the basics of connecting to a database, submitting a query, inserting data, updating data and removing data. It also has a section on how to do stored procedures that might be helpful later-on for queries that get called often and can be offloaded to the server. Additionally it covers escaping user inputs that I would like to do at some point. Speaking of security, one thing that I didn't find was some method to protect the connection details. Having the username and password sitting around in a file isn't the safest. There is quite a lot that I don't know about security and I'm very interested in getting updated before this app goes online. What I was able to do though, was to lock down the login credentials in a .env file. I came across this solution from Stack Overflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57470659/how-to-hide-connection-details-for-mysql-database-in-node-js">How to hide connection details for mysql database in node.js?</a>. Additional details for implementation were found on the <a href="https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv">dotenv GitHub page</a>. The completed tutorial is posted to my GitHub project <a href="https://github.com/KionoKitse/FridgeMate-P11_00_00/tree/main/Tutorials/MySQL">here</a>.
