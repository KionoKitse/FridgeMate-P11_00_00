APPROVED: Calculating recipe buildability score
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the more confusing logic components for this app is the calculation needed to determine which recipes can be made. For example, let's say you want to make a diy macaroni and cheese recipe. The recipe calls for:
	<ul>
		<li>Cheddar cheese</li>
		<li>Macaroni</li>
		<li>Soy milk</li>
		<li>Butter</li>
		<li>Flour</li>
		<li>Salt</li>
		<li>Black pepper</li>
		<li>Yellow onions</li>
		<li>Garlic</li>
		<li>Parmesan</li>
	</ul>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll admit this isn't the normal macaroni can cheese. One could easily get away with making this without some of the ingredients. If I had all the ingredients in the pantry it would be easy to say that I can make this recipe but what if I am missing black pepper, Parmesan, onion and soy milk? Clearly some ingredients are not as important as other ingredients. To address this case, I've divided the ingredients into four categories; main, support, spices, and garnish. A main ingredient is far more important than a garnish, so I've given each category a weight. 
	Category: Main 75%
	<ul>
		<li>Cheddar cheese (available)</li>
		<li>Macaroni (available)</li>
		<li>Soy milk (unavailable)</li>
	</ul>
	Category: Support 20%
	<ul>
		<li>Butter (available)</li>
		<li>Flour (available)</li>
		<li>Yellow onions (unavailable)</li>
	</ul>
	Category: Spices 3%
	<ul>
		<li>Salt (available)</li>
		<li>Black pepper (unavailable)</li>
		<li>Garlic (available)</li>
	</ul>
	Category: Garnish 2%
	<ul>
		<li>Parmesan (unavailable)</li>
	</ul>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this list, the recipe would have a buildability score of (75(2/3)+20(2/3)+3(2/3)+2(0/1) = 65) 65%. Clearly it is a problem that I don't have soy milk or yellow onions but let's say I have red onions. It's not exactly the same ingredient but they are relatively similar and could be substituted for the yellow onions. To handle substitutions the database will have groups of similar ingredients. Let's say that there is a group that contains; red onions, green onions, yellow onions and shallots. If a recipe calls for any member of that group and it is not available, the app can check if any member of that group is available as a substitute. To take into consideration that a green onion is not quite the same as a yellow onion I will weight a substitute ingredient as half of a requested ingredient. This results in the recipe having a sore of (75(2/3)+20(2.5/3)+3(2/3)+2(0/1) = 69) 69%. 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one final case that needs to be taken into consideration. What if I can build one of the ingredients. Let's say that I don't have soy milk but I have soy beans and water, so I can make soy milk. This doesn't make much logical sense in the given example as nobody is going to be making soy milk just so they can make macaroni and cheese. The buildable ingredient clause was intended to be used for stuff more like poultry seasoning and hoisin sauce. Stuff that I typically won't have around but can easily make with ingredients that are already available. Anyway back to our example. In cases where an ingredient is not available and there is a reference to a recipe for that ingredient. The app will check that recipe to see if the ingredient can be made. In our example, we have soy beans and water so we can make soy milk and thus we have that ingredient. The final tally for the macaroni and cheese recipe is (75(2/3)+20(2.5/3)+3(2/3)+2(0/1)=94) 94%. 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus ends our calculation of how buildable the macaroni and cheese recipe is. This score will allow the app to determine which recipes could be purposed for a given meal. A recipe with a score of 94% would show up before a recipe with the score of 68%. The code below shows how this calculation is done in JavaScript.

Working: Dynamic pages or recipe page
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this app, I decided to start with writing the recipe page of the app. This is because it contained most of the functions that would be needed elsewhere and was a little easier to envision what I wanted it to look like. One of the things that would make the recipe page special is that it would be dynamic. I could have created an HTML page for each recipe but it seemed a little excessive and would likely result in needing to copy thousands of files. A dynamic page allows me to have a page template and add the recipe details when it was called. For the dynamic content like the name and etc there are two ways to go about this. I could use create the page Server Side or Client Side. For server side PHP seems to be what is used and for client side JavaScipt seems to be what is used. Originally I chose to do the page client side with JavaScript since I knew it better but eventually changed to server side. I like using JavaScript because there are a lot of good debuggers and community resources to help with solving issues. For me PHP is pretty hard to debug since it doesn't seem easy to step through the code. I tried a couple of debuggers but always had issues with getting them to work. The main reason for switching to server side rendering is because it's faster. There is no problem with doing client side rendering but if I wanted to get the MySQL data I would be going from server side to client side then client side would need to make a request to server side to get the MySQL data and then ultimately back to client side for rendering that data. It seemed less than optimal and after doing some research it seemed like for my specif application server side would be the optimal choice. Anyway so far I now have the recipe page working and I'm able to dynamically create the recipe page by feading it the RECIPE_ID and then it will get the resulst from MySQL and the JSON file before generating the page and rendering it.

Working: Folder structures
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I'm working on this project I'm starting to run into some issues with how to best organize my content. Some of the stuff is becoming really complex and is starting to get confusing about what should go where. This is probably nothing new for anyone who does this for a living but it's typically not something I have to manage since the stuff I do is usually just one page. Anyway for some of the dynamic content for the edit recipe page I need to do AJAX calls to a PHP file that runs a server side query against a database. The login credentials are hidden in another location. What I've noticed is that these php scripts seem to be sensitive to where they are located in reference to the login credentials. I haven't figured out the correct way place them anywhere and still have it work. I'm sure I will figure it out eventually but it does mean that I need to start making plans for how the app will be accessed within the context of my site. For this project, I've had to start hosting my own content independent of the free blogging platform that my site is currently on. Eventually I'll be moving the blog over since it will give me greater control over how my site behaves. What this means though is that I'll need to take a break from what I'm doing to plan the layout of the new site and make sure the app will function within that framework.

Working: Login credentials
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time long long ago I had a website that I made but this was like way back when AIM was still a thing. I remember I had it up for a while but hadn't accessed it in a while. When I came back to it I found that it had been hacked? Anyway the host had quarantined the site and I could no longer access the content and didn't have the energy to sort it out again. What I learned from this is that just because you have a site that is super low key doesn't mean that someone won't hop in and start playing with things. No animosity towards whoever did it but ya know one must keep such things in mind. Since this project will make use of a database with some inputs and etc it's going to be important to protect this content in some way. For this I'm thinking some sort of login mechanism. When a user decides to connect to the app they will be required to enter some login credentials. This I'm hoping will serve as a first level of defense against people messing with the database. It also might be useful if I ever expand this project to allow other people to login and use their own information in the framework by allowing different databased to be used.
