APPROVED: Barcode reading
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of functions in this app that will be difficult but this is the one that I have the least amount of understanding around and would be highly specific. I'm focusing on this aspect first since it will make my life much easier if I start from a platform that I know already supports barcode reading. In deciding what method to implement I started by looking for tutorials for how to do barcode reading in a web app. What I've found is that there are some pretty good tutorials and examples out there so it's not going to be groundbreaking new stuff. I have a full list of notes and links in the <a href="https://github.com/KionoKitse/FridgeMate-P11_00_00/blob/main/README.md">"GitHub README"</a> file under the Notebook section. The summary from my research is that there are two-ish options that I'm considering. The first option is using QuaggaJS or ZXing for a fairly capable standard barcode reading option. It will work on pretty much any modern browser and seems to be well loved by the community. The other option is making use of the Shape Detection API. This is fairly new so it is only supported in Chrome and requires enabling the Experimental Web Platform features. It seems to be fast and works well but it doesn't have widespread adoption yet and I'm not sure if it will work with iOS. For now I'm thinking that it would be best to start with QuaggaJS first and if that doesn't work move to the Shape Detection API.

APPROVED: MySQL with JavaScript
One of the critical components of this app is going to be the database. I've already decided on the database structure and that I'll be using MySQL to manage that database. This week I just finished doing a MySQL and JavaScript tutorial found <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/using-node-mysql-javascript-client/">here</a>. I found the tutorial to be really easy to follow and cover the basics of connecting to a database, submitting a query, inserting data, updating data and removing data. It also has a section on how to do stored procedures that might be helpful later-on for queries that get called often and can be offloaded to the server. Additionally it covers escaping user inputs that I would like to do at some point. Speaking of security, one thing that I didn't find was some method to protect the connection details. Having the username and password sitting around in a file isn't the safest. There is quite a lot that I don't know about security and I'm very interested in getting updated before this app goes online. What I was able to do though, was to lock down the login credentials in a .env file. I came across this solution from Stack Overflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57470659/how-to-hide-connection-details-for-mysql-database-in-node-js">How to hide connection details for mysql database in node.js?</a>. Additional details for implementation were found on the <a href="https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv">dotenv GitHub page</a>. The completed tutorial is posted to my GitHub project <a href="https://github.com/KionoKitse/FridgeMate-P11_00_00/tree/main/Tutorials/MySQL">here</a>.
