APPROVED: Data input methods
One of the features of this software will be some way to keep track of what ingredients are available in the pantry. This is something that could be quite time intensive and really impact the user experience of this app. What I want is a simple way to automatically mark items as available in the pantry. To do this I could go off the shopping list by marking items as bought but it would also be nice to add items that were not on the shopping list. For this, I decided that it would be good to implement a barcode reading function and a receipt scanning function. In addition, the app would have a manual entry mode for entering in new items.
The barcode reader functionality would be useful when I don't have a receipt or when I'm just scanning one item. A lot of products have a unique UPC code regardless of which store you buy it from. In fact I bet there is an online UPC database that could be leveraged but I haven't done any research on that yet. 
The receipt reader functionality would probably be the default mode for updating the inventory. It benefits from being able to update an entire list of items in one go. It also has the benefit of accessing the price data. There is quite a lot that could be done with that information such as comparing prices for similar items across many different stores and keeping track of when certain ingredients are the most affordable. For now though I won't be implementing any of those features until I get the base functionality working. It will be a little challenging because each store has its own formatting and inventory numbers but I think it would be the easiest way to update the inventory.
The two above methods work well for updating the inventory when an ingredient already exists in the database. For cases when I am adding in a completely new ingredient, the manual entry method would be best. This would allow for entering in very specific parameters and ensuring data model conformity. I would like this feature to be available on the mobile platform but I expect that typically new ingredients would be manually entered on the PC interface. 

APPROVED: Barcode reading
There are a lot of functions in this app that will be difficult but this is the one that I have the least amount of understanding around and would be highly specific. I'm focusing on this aspect first since it will make my life much easier if I start from a platform that I know already supports barcode reading. In deciding what method to implement I started by looking for tutorials for how to do barcode reading in a web app. What I've found is that there are some pretty good tutorials and examples out there so it's not going to be groundbreaking new stuff. I have a full list of notes and links in the <a href="https://github.com/KionoKitse/FridgeMate-P11_00_00/blob/main/README.md">"GitHub README"</a> file under the Notebook section. The summary from my research is that there are two-ish options that I'm considering. The first option is using QuaggaJS or ZXing for a fairly capable standard barcode reading option. It will work on pretty much any modern browser and seems to be well loved by the community. The other option is making use of the Shape Detection API. This is fairly new so it is only supported in Chrome and requires enabling the Experimental Web Platform features. It seems to be fast and works well but it doesn't have widespread adoption yet and I'm not sure if it will work with iOS. For now I'm thinking that it would be best to start with QuaggaJS first and if that doesn't work move to the Shape Detection API.

APPROVED: MySQL with JavaScript
One of the critical components of this app is going to be the database. I've already decided on the database structure and that I'll be using MySQL to manage that database. This week I just finished doing a MySQL and JavaScript tutorial found <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/using-node-mysql-javascript-client/">here</a>. I found the tutorial to be really easy to follow and cover the basics of connecting to a database, submitting a query, inserting data, updating data and removing data. It also has a section on how to do stored procedures that might be helpful later-on for queries that get called often and can be offloaded to the server. Additionally it covers escaping user inputs that I would like to do at some point. Speaking of security, one thing that I didn't find was some method to protect the connection details. Having the username and password sitting around in a file isn't the safest. There is quite a lot that I don't know about security and I'm very interested in getting updated before this app goes online. What I was able to do though, was to lock down the login credentials in a .env file. I came across this solution from Stack Overflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57470659/how-to-hide-connection-details-for-mysql-database-in-node-js">How to hide connection details for mysql database in node.js?</a>. Additional details for implementation were found on the <a href="https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv">dotenv GitHub page</a>. The completed tutorial is posted to my GitHub project <a href="https://github.com/KionoKitse/FridgeMate-P11_00_00/tree/main/Tutorials/MySQL">here</a>.
