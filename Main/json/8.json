The chef also suggests it on a good slice of bread topped with fresh tomatoes or in a tomato salad.","Steps":["","In a blender, add all the ingredients except the oil.\nStart the blender at medium speed and add the oil slowly, in a stream, to create an emulsion.\nMix, increasing the speed if necessary, until a puree is obtained.\nThe pesto should be creamy and smooth. There should not be any oil floating on top of the preparation; this means that the oil was added too quickly."]}
